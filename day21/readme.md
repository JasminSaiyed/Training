+ Project 01: 
+ Project Overview:
The goal of this capstone project is to combine shell scripting with system monitoring and log management practices. You will create a set of automated tools using shell scripts to manage logs, monitor system performance using Prometheus and Node Exporter, and generate insights using PromQL queries. The project will require a systematic approach, covering scripting fundamentals, log management, and monitoring setup.
+ Project Deliverables:
- Shell Scripts for Basic Operations:
Task: Write shell scripts to perform basic system operations, such as checking disk usage, memory usage, and CPU load.
Deliverable:
A collection of scripts that output system performance metrics.
Scripts should include error handling and logging.

- Create Basic_Opearion .sh

#!/bin/bash

LOG_FILE="logs/system_log_$(date +'%Y%m%d_%H%M%S').log"

# Check disk usage
echo "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------" >> $LOG_FILE
echo "Check disk usage" >> $LOG_FILE
echo "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------" >> $LOG_FILE
df -h >> $LOG_FILE

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error checking disk usage" >> $LOG_FILE
    exit 1
fi

# Check memory usage
echo "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------" >> $LOG_FILE
echo "Check memory usage" >> $LOG_FILE
echo "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------" >> $LOG_FILE
free -h >> $LOG_FILE

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error checking memory usage" >> $LOG_FILE
    exit 1
fi

# Check CPU load
echo "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------" >> $LOG_FILE
echo "Check CPU load" >> $LOG_FILE
echo "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------" >> $LOG_FILE
top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" >> $LOG_FILE

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error checking CPU load" >> $LOG_FILE
    exit 1
fi

- Log Management Script:
Task: Develop a script to automate log management tasks such as log rotation and archiving. This script should include the ability to compress old logs and delete logs older than a specified number of days.
Deliverable:
A shell script that performs log rotation based on predefined conditions (e.g., log size, log age).
A report generated by the script detailing which logs were rotated, compressed, or deleted.
- Create log_management.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Define the output file 

OUTPUT_FILE="logs/archive/log_report.txt"

# Functions Of disk_usage , Check Memory and check CPU load
check_log() {
    echo "logs are shown below :-"
    cat /var/log/syslog | tail -n 4
    echo
}

# Write the results to the output file if specified
if [ -n "$OUTPUT_FILE" ]; then
    {
        check_log
    } > "$OUTPUT_FILE" 

    echo "Report saved to $OUTPUT_FILE"
fi

- Advanced Shell Scripting - Loops, Conditions, Functions, and Error Handling:
Task: Refactor the previous scripts to include loops, conditionals, and functions for modularity. Implement error handling to manage potential issues during script execution.
Deliverable:
Modular shell scripts that use functions for repeatable tasks.
Error-handling mechanisms in place for scenarios like missing files, insufficient permissions, etc.
Logs that track script execution and any errors encountered.
- Create adv_shell_script.sh
#!/bin/bash

LOG_DIR="logs"
ARCHIVE_DIR="logs/archive"
DAYS_TO_KEEP=30

# Error handling function
handle_error() {
  echo "Error on line $1"
  exit 1
}

# Trap errors
trap 'handle_error $LINENO' ERR

# Rotate and compress logs
rotate_logs() {
  for log_file in "$LOG_DIR"/*.log; do
    if [[ -f "$log_file" ]]; then
      gzip "$log_file"
      mv "$log_file.gz" "$ARCHIVE_DIR"
    fi
  done
}

# Delete old logs
delete_old_logs() {
  find "$ARCHIVE_DIR" -type f -name "*.gz" -mtime +$DAYS_TO_KEEP -delete
}

# Main function
main() {
  rotate_logs
  delete_old_logs
}

- Log Checking and Troubleshooting:
Task: Write a script that reads through system and application logs, identifies common issues (e.g., out of memory, failed service starts), and provides troubleshooting steps based on log analysis.
Deliverable:
A script that parses logs for errors or warnings and outputs possible root causes.
Documentation on the types of logs checked and the issues identified.
A troubleshooting guide based on common errors found in the logs.

- Create log.sh

#!/bin/bash

SYSLOG_FILE="/var/log/syslog"
AUTH_LOG_FILE="/var/log/auth.log"

check_logs() {
    local file=$1
    local keyword=$2
    echo "Checking $file for '$keyword'..."
    grep "$keyword" "$file" | tail -n 5
}

echo "Starting log check..."
echo "System Log Errors "
check_logs $SYSLOG_FILE "error"

echo "Authentication Failures "
check_logs $AUTH_LOG_FILE "authentication failure"

echo "Log check completed."

- Installation and Setup of Prometheus and Node Exporter:
Task: Install and configure Prometheus and Node Exporter on the system. Ensure that Node Exporter is properly configured to collect system metrics.
Deliverable:
A documented installation and configuration process for Prometheus and Node Exporter.
A running instance of Prometheus scraping metrics from Node Exporter.

- Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) Basic Queries:
Task: Create a series of PromQL queries to monitor system performance, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk I/O.
Deliverable:
A set of PromQL queries that can be used to monitor key system metrics.
A dashboard setup guide or configuration that visualizes these metrics in Prometheus or Grafana.
Final Report and Presentation:
Task: Prepare a final report documenting all scripts, the installation and configuration of monitoring tools, and the output of your PromQL queries.
Deliverable:
A comprehensive project report covering all steps, scripts, and results.
